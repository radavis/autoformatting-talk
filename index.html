# .off-white[Code Formatting & You]

???

Today, I want to talk about an often overlooked aspect of maintaining a project:
How you format your code.

---

# Your New Project!

???

There's nothing like the feeling of firing off a new project. I do this all the
time. I especally like to do this when I need a sandbox to work in and try things
out.

---

# The Consistency Problem...

* ending files w/ a newline, or not
* consistent naming of functions, variables, Classes, and CONSTANTS
* enforce an 80 character line limit, or don't
* placement of braces (same line, or next line)
* tabs v. spaces ðŸ˜©

???

When we start a new project, we have a number of decisions to make.

First, you have to make decisions on all these, or which code style guide to use.

Address code consistency in code review.

# Code Style Guides

pro: decisions are made for you
con: you have to pick one

Scroll down, there's an article comparing style guides...

Just pick one. Don't think too hard about it.

# Code Review

???

Do you really want to tell your colleague their indentation is off? That they
should name their function `get_value` instead of `getValue`?

# Linters!

Run a command, get feedback.

A step in the right direction.Â

Allow me to introduce the most annoying tool I've ever used.

There's got to be a better way...

gofmt takes linting a step further, and corrects the problem. Welcome to the future!

# Influence Positive Dialog

???

As a project creator, you have the ability (and responsibility) to influence the
dialog in and around your codebase. Make it quality dialog, and don't pick nits.

What are your experiences with managing code consistency? Were you familiar
with code formatters before this talk? Where do you place them in your pipeline?
